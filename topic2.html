        </h1>

        <p> NumPy is a Python library.<br>

            NumPy is used for working with arrays.<br>
            
            NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".<br>  <br><a href="#top"> go to the topic</a>

        <h2 style="color: chocolate">Learning by Reading</h2>
        <p>T We have created 43 tutorial pages for you to learn more about NumPy.<br>

            Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data sets, and working with NumPy <br><a href="#top"> go to the topic</a>
            
            <h2 style="color:chocolate">What is NumPy? </h2>
            <p>NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.<br>

                It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.<br>
                
                NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.<br>
                
                NumPy stands for Numerical Python.<br></p><a href="#top"> go to the topic</a>

                <h2  style="color: chocolate">Why Use NumPy?</h2>
                <p>In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.<br>

                    NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.<br>
                    
                    The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
                    
                    Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.</p><br>

                 <h2  style="color: chocolate">Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?</h2>
                 <p>NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.<br>

                    This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.<br>
                    
                    This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.<br>
